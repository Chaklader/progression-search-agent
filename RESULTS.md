You're correct. You've successfully run all the search algorithms on problems 1 and 2, and the results are captured in the output you've provided. Let me summarize the information you requested for each problem and algorithm:

For Air Cargo Problem 1:

1. Number of actions in the domain: 20

2. Number of new node expansions and time to complete for each algorithm:

   - breadth_first_search: 178 expansions, 0.0078 seconds
   - depth_first_graph_search: 84 expansions, 0.0017 seconds
   - uniform_cost_search: 240 expansions, 0.0050 seconds
   - greedy_best_first_graph_search (h_unmet_goals): 29 expansions, 0.0007 seconds
   - greedy_best_first_graph_search (h_pg_levelsum): 28 expansions, 0.1146 seconds
   - greedy_best_first_graph_search (h_pg_maxlevel): 24 expansions, 0.0238 seconds
   - greedy_best_first_graph_search (h_pg_setlevel): 28 expansions, 0.1191 seconds
   - astar_search (h_unmet_goals): 206 expansions, 0.0046 seconds
   - astar_search (h_pg_levelsum): 122 expansions, 0.0822 seconds
   - astar_search (h_pg_maxlevel): 180 expansions, 0.0315 seconds
   - astar_search (h_pg_setlevel): 138 expansions, 0.0891 seconds

For Air Cargo Problem 2:

1. Number of actions in the domain: 72

2. Number of new node expansions and time to complete for each algorithm:

   - breadth_first_search: 30503 expansions, 0.1175 seconds
   - depth_first_graph_search: 5602 expansions, 0.1784 seconds
   - uniform_cost_search: 46618 expansions, 0.2349 seconds
   - greedy_best_first_graph_search (h_unmet_goals): 170 expansions, 0.0038 seconds
   - greedy_best_first_graph_search (h_pg_levelsum): 86 expansions, 0.3027 seconds
   - greedy_best_first_graph_search (h_pg_maxlevel): 249 expansions, 0.2063 seconds
   - greedy_best_first_graph_search (h_pg_setlevel): 84 expansions, 0.4539 seconds
   - astar_search (h_unmet_goals): 22522 expansions, 0.2632 seconds
   - astar_search (h_pg_levelsum): 3426 expansions, 7.4680 seconds
   - astar_search (h_pg_maxlevel): 26594 expansions, 18.2880 seconds
   - astar_search (h_pg_setlevel): 9605 expansions, 38.9837 seconds

These results provide a good basis for comparing the performance of different search algorithms on these two problem instances.


Based on the results from problems 1 and 2, we can make the following observations:

1. Among the uninformed search algorithms, breadth_first_search and uniform_cost_search perform reasonably well and provide optimal solutions. depth_first_graph_search, while fast, often produces very long, suboptimal plans.

2. The greedy best-first search algorithms, especially with h_unmet_goals and h_pg_levelsum heuristics, perform well in terms of speed and solution quality.

3. A* search with h_unmet_goals and h_pg_levelsum heuristics provide a good balance between optimality and performance.

Given these observations, for problems 3 and 4, I recommend running the following:

1. One uninformed search: uniform_cost_search (it's optimal and performs better than breadth-first search)
2. Two heuristics with greedy best first search: h_unmet_goals and h_pg_levelsum
3. Two heuristics with A*: h_unmet_goals and h_pg_levelsum

Here's the command to run these selected algorithms on problems 3 and 4:

```
pypy3 run_search.py -p 3 4 -s 3 4 5 8 9
```

This command breaks down as follows:
- `-p 3 4`: Run on problems 3 and 4
- `-s 3 4 5 8 9`: Run the following search algorithms:
  - 3: uniform_cost_search
  - 4: greedy_best_first_graph_search with h_unmet_goals
  - 5: greedy_best_first_graph_search with h_pg_levelsum
  - 8: astar_search with h_unmet_goals
  - 9: astar_search with h_pg_levelsum

This selection should give you a good mix of uninformed and informed search strategies, allowing you to compare their performance on the more complex problems 3 and 4.

Certainly. Let's review the results for Air Cargo Problems 3 and 4:

Air Cargo Problem 3:

1. Number of actions in the domain: 88

2. Results for each algorithm:
   - uniform_cost_search: 161,936 expansions, 0.5955 seconds
   - greedy_best_first_graph_search (h_unmet_goals): 230 expansions, 0.0071 seconds
   - greedy_best_first_graph_search (h_pg_levelsum): 126 expansions, 0.8909 seconds
   - astar_search (h_unmet_goals): 65,711 expansions, 0.5215 seconds
   - astar_search (h_pg_levelsum): 3,403 expansions, 12.1527 seconds

Air Cargo Problem 4:

1. Number of actions in the domain: 104

2. Results for each algorithm:
   - uniform_cost_search: 1,066,413 expansions, 3.5885 seconds
   - greedy_best_first_graph_search (h_unmet_goals): 280 expansions, 0.0105 seconds
   - greedy_best_first_graph_search (h_pg_levelsum): 165 expansions, 1.1658 seconds
   - astar_search (h_unmet_goals): 328,509 expansions, 1.8458 seconds
   - astar_search (h_pg_levelsum): 12,210 expansions, 67.4415 seconds

Observations:
1. Uninformed search (uniform_cost_search) performs poorly as problem complexity increases, with a significant increase in node expansions and time.

2. Greedy best-first search with both heuristics performs very well in terms of speed and node expansions, but may not always find the optimal solution.

3. A* search with h_unmet_goals provides a good balance between optimality and performance.

4. A* search with h_pg_levelsum finds optimal or near-optimal solutions but takes significantly longer, especially for the more complex Problem 4.

5. The h_unmet_goals heuristic generally performs faster than h_pg_levelsum, but h_pg_levelsum often results in fewer node expansions.

These results confirm that the selection of algorithms for problems 3 and 4 was appropriate, providing a good mix of performance and solution quality across different search strategies.
