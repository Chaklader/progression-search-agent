This course introduces a knowledge-based AI agent who can reason and plan. This lesson shows how to use symbols to represent 
logic and reasoning. Before we move on to the next lesson on the introduction to planning, let's recap what we have learned 
in this lesson.

As we have seen in the previous course, a problem-solving AI agent does not store knowledge about the world. The agent relies 
on the algorithms, such as Constraint Satisfaction Problem and Search, to find the solutions in state space. A knowledge-based 
AI agent, however, has full or partial knowledge about the world and can make inferences from the knowledge.

For a knowledge-based AI agent to be able to reason and plan, they must apply logic to the knowledge about the world. The 
simplest form of logic is Propositional Logic. Propositional logic is the simplest language consisting of symbols and logical 
connectives. But it can only handle boolean propositions, which are True, False or Unknown.

We moved on to learn First Order Logic, which can help the knowledge-based agents to learn about the knowledge of the world 
through the more powerful knowledge representations. FOL is built around objects and relations. It also has universal and 
existential quantifiers to construct assertions about all or some of the possible values of the quantified variables.

In the next lesson, we will learn how to define problems so our knowledge-based AI agents can plan to solve the problems 
through explicit propositional and relations between states and actions.


Propositional Logic
<br>
–––––––––––––––

Propositional logic is a fundamental form of logic that deals with propositions (statements that are either true or false) 
and logical connectives. It's a building block for more complex logical systems and is crucial in AI for representing and 
reasoning about knowledge.

Key Components:

1. Propositional Symbols:
   - Represent atomic propositions (e.g., B for Burglary, E for Earthquake)
   - Can be either true or false

2. Logical Connectives:
   - NOT (¬): Negation
   - AND (∧): Conjunction
   - OR (∨): Disjunction
   - IMPLY (⇒): Implication
   - IF AND ONLY IF (⇔): Biconditional

3. Model:
   - A set of true/false assignments to all propositional symbols
   - Example: {B: True, E: False, A: True, M: False, J: True}

4. Sentences:
   - Formed by combining propositional symbols with connectives
   - Example: (E ∨ B) ⇒ A (If there's an Earthquake OR Burglary, then the Alarm will sound)

5. Truth Values:
   - Sentences are evaluated as either true or false with respect to a given model
   - Truth tables are used to define the meaning of connectives

Example Sentences:
- A ⇒ (J ∧ M): If the Alarm sounds, then John AND Mary will call
- J ⇔ M: John calls if and only if Mary calls
- J ⇔ ¬M: John calls if and only if Mary doesn't call

Key Points:
1. Propositional logic deals with absolute truth values, not probabilities.
2. It's limited to expressing facts about specific propositions and can't generalize.
3. Truth tables are used to evaluate complex sentences.
4. It forms the basis for more complex logics like First-Order Logic.


In AI and automated planning, propositional logic is used to represent states, actions, and goals in a simple, boolean manner. 
It allows for basic reasoning about the truth of statements in different scenarios, which is fundamental for planning and 
decision-making algorithms.


Truth Table


| P     | Q     | ¬P    | P ∧ Q | P ∨ Q | P ⇒ Q | P ⇔ Q |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| False | False | True  | False | False | True  | True  |
| False | True  | True  | False | True  | True  | False |
| True  | False | False | False | True  | False | False |
| True  | True  | False | True  | True  | True  | True  |

Explanation of the truth table:

1. ¬P (NOT P):
   - True when P is False, False when P is True.

2. P ∧ Q (P AND Q):
   - True only when both P and Q are True.

3. P ∨ Q (P OR Q):
   - True when either P or Q (or both) are True.

4. P ⇒ Q (P IMPLIES Q):
   - False only when P is True and Q is False.
   - True in all other cases, including when P is False (vacuous truth).

5. P ⇔ Q (P IF AND ONLY IF Q):
   - True when P and Q have the same truth value (both True or both False).
   - False when P and Q have different truth values.


This truth table is fundamental in propositional logic as it defines the behavior of logical connectives for all possible 
combinations of truth values of P and Q. It allows us to evaluate complex logical statements by breaking them down into 
their constituent parts and applying these rules.



Q#1: (P is false, Q is false):
Correct answer: (P ∧ (P ⇒ Q)) ⇔ (¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q))

Explanation:
- P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) is false because P is false.
- ¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q) is false because ¬P ∨ ¬Q is true (both ¬P and ¬Q are true).
- The equivalence of two false statements is true.

Q#2(P is false, Q is true):
Correct answer: (P ∧ (P ⇒ Q)) ⇔ (¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q))

Explanation:
- P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) is false because P is false.
- ¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q) is false because ¬P ∨ ¬Q is true (¬P is true).
- The equivalence of two false statements is true.

Q#3(P is true, Q is false):
Correct answer: (P ∧ (P ⇒ Q)) ⇔ (¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q))

Explanation:
- P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) is false because P ⇒ Q is false when P is true and Q is false.
- ¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q) is false because ¬P ∨ ¬Q is true (¬Q is true).
- The equivalence of two false statements is true.

Q#4(P is true, Q is true):
Correct answers: All three statements

Explanation:
- P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) is true because both P and P ⇒ Q are true.
- ¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q) is true because ¬P ∨ ¬Q is false (both ¬P and ¬Q are false).
- (P ∧ (P ⇒ Q)) ⇔ (¬ (¬P ∨ ¬Q)) is true because both sides are true.


In all cases, the equivalence statement is true because it represents a tautology - a statement that is always true regardless 
of the truth values of its components. This demonstrates an important principle in propositional logic about logical 
equivalences.


Q#1:
Given that (E v B) ⇔ A, A ⇔ (J ∧ M), and B are all true statements, what is the value of the variable E?

Correct Answer: Cannot be determined
Explanation: While we know B is true, E could be either true or false. If E is true, (E v B) is true. If E is false, (E v B) 
is still true because B is true. Therefore, we can't determine E's specific value.

Q#2:
Given that (E v B) ⇔ A, A ⇔ (J ∧ M), and B are all true statements, what is the value of the variable B?

Correct Answer: True
Explanation: The question directly states that B is a true statement.

Q#3:
Given that (E v B) ⇔ A, A ⇔ (J ∧ M), and B are all true statements, what is the value of the variable A?

Correct Answer: True
Explanation: Since (E v B) ⇔ A is true and B is true, (E v B) is true. Therefore, A must be true for the equivalence to hold.

Q#4:
Given that (E v B) ⇔ A, A ⇔ (J ∧ M), and B are all true statements, what is the value of the variable J?

Correct Answer: Cannot be determined
Explanation: We know A is true, and A ⇔ (J ∧ M) is true. This means (J ∧ M) must be true, but we can't determine if J is true 
or false without knowing M's value.

Q#5:
Given that (E v B) ⇔ A, A ⇔ (J ∧ M), and B are all true statements, what is the value of the variable M?

Correct Answer: Cannot be determined
Explanation: Similar to J, we know (J ∧ M) is true, but we can't determine M's specific value without knowing J's value.


1. Valid Sentence:
   - Definition: A sentence that is true in every possible model.
   - Explanation: No matter what truth values you assign to the individual propositional symbols, the sentence always evaluates to true.
   - Example: P ∨ ¬P (P or not P) is valid because it's always true regardless of whether P is true or false.
   - Also known as a tautology.

2. Satisfiable Sentence:
   - Definition: A sentence that is true in at least one model.
   - Explanation: There exists at least one assignment of truth values to the propositional symbols that makes the sentence true.
   - Example: P ∧ Q is satisfiable because it's true when both P and Q are true, even though it's not true in all cases.
   - Note: All valid sentences are satisfiable, but not all satisfiable sentences are valid.

3. Unsatisfiable Sentence:
   - Definition: A sentence that cannot be true in any possible model.
   - Explanation: No matter what truth values you assign to the propositional symbols, the sentence always evaluates to false.
   - Example: P ∧ ¬P (P and not P) is unsatisfiable because it's always false.
   - Also known as a contradiction.

Key Points:
- A valid sentence is true in all models.
- A satisfiable sentence is true in at least one model.
- An unsatisfiable sentence is false in all models.
- Every sentence is either satisfiable or unsatisfiable.
- Valid sentences are a subset of satisfiable sentences.


These concepts are crucial in logical reasoning and form the basis for many algorithms in artificial intelligence, including 
automated theorem proving and logical inference systems.


Q#1:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? P ∨ ¬P

Correct Answer: Valid
Explanation: This sentence is a tautology, which is always true regardless of the truth value of P. If P is true, P ∨ ¬P 
is true. If P is false, ¬P is true, so P ∨ ¬P is still true. Therefore, it's valid (true in all possible models).


Q#2:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? P ∧ ¬P

Correct Answer: Unsatisfiable
Explanation: This sentence is a contradiction. It can never be true because P cannot be simultaneously true and false. 
Therefore, it's unsatisfiable (false in all possible models).


Q#3:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? P ∨ (P ∧ Q)

Correct Answer: Not provided in the image, but the correct answer would be Satisfiable.
Explanation: This sentence is true whenever P is true, regardless of Q's value. It's also true when both P and Q are true. 
However, it's false when P is false and Q is true. Therefore, it's satisfiable (true in some models, but not all).


Q#4:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ ¬Q)

Correct Answer: Not provided in the image, but the correct answer would be Satisfiable.
Explanation: This sentence is equivalent to P ∧ (Q ∨ ¬Q). It's true whenever P is true, regardless of Q's value. However, 
it's false when P is false. Therefore, it's satisfiable (true in some models, but not all).


Q#5:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? ((Food ∧ Party) ∨ (Drinks ∧ Party)) ⇔ ((Food ∨ Drinks) ∧ Party)


Correct Answer: Not provided in the image, but the correct answer would be Valid.
Explanation: This sentence is a logical equivalence. The left side is true when there's a party with food or drinks (or both). 
The right side expresses the same condition. This equivalence holds for all possible combinations of truth values for Food, Drinks, 
and Party. Therefore, it's valid (true in all possible models).


Limitations of Propositional Logic 

   1. It can only handle boolean value (ie. true or false) and does not have a capability to handle complex values, such as 
      uncertainty (probability value).
   2. It can't include objects that have properties, such as size, weight, color, nor shows the relationship between objects.
   3. There are no shortcuts to succinctly talk about a lot of different things happening.


Building Elements of First Order Logic (FOL)

   1. Objects: are the noun phrases that refer to things, such as a house, a person, an event.

   2. Relations: are the verb phrases among the objects. The relations can be a property, such as "the car is red", or a function, 
      which maps the input to an output, such as "times two". FOL expresses the facts about some or all of the objects in the world. 
      It represents the general laws or rules. For example, in this sentence of "Peter Norvig wrote the best Artificial Intelligence 
      textbook", the objects are "Peter Norvig" and "textbook", the property are "the best" and "Artificial Intelligence", and the relation is "wrote".


FOL may remind you of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Similar to FOL, OOP is a programming paradigm around objects, 
rather than functions or logics. Both FOL and OOP objects can have properties and functions (or methods). FOL, however, 
is different from OOP, in which FOL has a declarative nature that separates the knowledge of the world and their inferences. 
The other difference is that OOP lacks the expressiveness required to handle partial information, such as if x is in loc A, 
then it is not in loc B.


1. Propositional Logic Models:
   - In PL, a model is a simple assignment of truth values (true or false) to propositional variables.
   - Each variable represents an entire proposition, which is a statement that is either true or false.
   - Example: pl_model = { P: true, Q: false, R: true }
   - This model states that proposition P is true, Q is false, and R is true.
   - PL cannot represent internal structure within these propositions.

2. First Order Logic Models:
   - In FOL, a model is more complex and represents a richer structure of the world.
   - It consists of:
     a) A domain of objects (e.g., people, books)
     b) Relations between these objects
     c) Functions that map objects to other objects
   - Example: fol_model = { Write(Author(Peter), Book(AI textbook)) }
   - This model represents:
     * Objects: Peter (an Author), AI textbook (a Book)
     * Function: Author() maps a name to an author object
     * Function: Book() maps a title to a book object
     * Relation: Write() represents the action of an author writing a book

3. Key Differences:
   - Expressiveness: FOL can express relationships and properties of objects, while PL can only express truth values of whole statements.
   - Structure: FOL models have internal structure (objects, relations, functions), while PL models are flat assignments.
   - Quantification: FOL allows for statements about all objects or some objects in the domain, which is not possible in PL.
   - Partial Information: FOL can handle partial information about objects and their relationships, which PL cannot do effectively.

4. Implications:
   - FOL can represent more complex scenarios and reasoning tasks.
   - It allows for more nuanced and detailed modeling of real-world situations.
   - FOL supports reasoning about categories of objects and their properties, not just individual propositions.

5. Example Comparison:
   - PL: "It's raining" (R) and "The ground is wet" (W) might be represented as R ∧ W
   - FOL: "All days when it rains, the ground is wet" might be represented as ∀x(Raining(x) → Wet(Ground, x))
     where x represents days, Raining is a predicate about days, and Wet is a relation between objects and days.


In summary, FOL models provide a much richer and more flexible framework for representing knowledge about the world, allowing 
for more sophisticated reasoning and inference compared to the simpler boolean world of Propositional Logic.


The symbols ∀ and ∃ are quantifiers in First Order Logic (FOL). They are fundamental to expressing complex logical statements 
about sets of objects. Let's break them down:

1. ∀ (Universal Quantifier):
   - Pronunciation: "For all" or "For every"
   - Meaning: It indicates that the statement is true for all instances in the domain.
   - Example: ∀x P(x) means "For all x, P(x) is true"
   - Real-world usage: ∀x (Human(x) → Mortal(x))
     This means "For all x, if x is human, then x is mortal"

2. ∃ (Existential Quantifier):
   - Pronunciation: "There exists" or "For some"
   - Meaning: It indicates that the statement is true for at least one instance in the domain.
   - Example: ∃x P(x) means "There exists an x such that P(x) is true"
   - Real-world usage: ∃x (Planet(x) ∧ HasLife(x))
     This means "There exists an x such that x is a planet and x has life"

Key points:
- ∀ is often used with implications (→)
- ∃ is often used with conjunctions (∧)
- These quantifiers allow FOL to express more complex ideas than propositional logic
- They can be combined to create even more sophisticated statements

Example combining both:
∀x (Dog(x) → ∃y (Human(y) ∧ Owns(y, x)))
This means "For all x, if x is a dog, then there exists a y such that y is human and y owns x"

In AI and automated reasoning, these quantifiers are crucial for representing general knowledge and making inferences about 
sets of objects or entities.



1. Components of FOL Syntax:

   a) Sentences: Describe facts that are true or false.
      Examples: 
      - Vowel(A)
      - Above(A, B)
      - 2 = 2

   b) Terms: Describe objects.
      Examples:
      - Constants: A, B, 2
      - Variables: x, y
      - Functions: Number_of(A)

2. Logical Connectives:
   ¬ (NOT), ∧ (AND), ∨ (OR), ⇒ (IMPLY), ⇔ (IF AND ONLY IF)
   
   These work similarly to propositional logic.

3. Quantifiers:
   a) Universal Quantifier (∀): "For all"
   b) Existential Quantifier (∃): "There exists"

4. Syntax Patterns:

   a) Universal Quantification often uses implication:
      ∀x Vowel(x) ⇒ Number_of(x) = 1
      "For all x, if x is a vowel, then the number of x is 1."

   b) Existential Quantification often uses conjunction:
      ∃x Number_of(x) = 2
      "There exists an x such that the number of x is 2."

5. Additional Examples:

   a) ∀x Dog(x) ⇒ Mammal(x)
      "All dogs are mammals."

   b) ∃x Planet(x) ∧ HasRings(x)
      "There exists a planet that has rings."

   c) ∀x (Student(x) ∧ Hardworking(x)) ⇒ WillSucceed(x)
      "For all x, if x is a student and x is hardworking, then x will succeed."

   d) ∃x Politician(x) ∧ Honest(x)
      "There exists a politician who is honest."

6. Important Notes:

   - Omitting quantifiers usually implies universal quantification.
   - Universal quantification (∀) naturally pairs with implication (⇒).
   - Existential quantification (∃) naturally pairs with conjunction (∧).
   - FOL allows for more complex and nuanced expressions than propositional logic.

7. Practical Application:

   In AI and automated reasoning, FOL can be used to represent complex knowledge and make inferences. For example, in a 
   robot navigation system:

   ∀x (Obstacle(x) ⇒ Avoid(robot, x))
   "For all x, if x is an obstacle, the robot should avoid x."

   ∃x (SafePath(x) ∧ LeadsTo(x, goal))
   "There exists a safe path that leads to the goal."

These constructs allow AI systems to reason about general principles and specific instances in a way that closely mimics 
human logical thinking.


First Order Logic in Vacuum World
<br>
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. Initial State:
   At(V,A)
   - The vacuum cleaner V is initially at location A.

2. Equations:

   a) ∀d ∀l Dirt(d) ∧ Loc(l) ⇒ ¬At(d,l)
      Interpretation: For all dirt d and locations l, if d is dirt and l is a location, then d is not at l.
      Meaning: Initially, no dirt is at any location.

   b) ∃l ∃d Dirt(d) ∧ Loc(l) ∧ At(V,l) ∧ At(d,l)
      Interpretation: There exists a location l and dirt d such that d is dirt, l is a location, the vacuum is at l, and the dirt is at l.
      Meaning: There is at least one location where both the vacuum and some dirt are present.

   c) ∀R Transitive(R) ⇔ (∀a,b,c R(a,b) ∧ R(b,c) ⇒ R(a,c))
      Interpretation: For all relations R, R is transitive if and only if for all a, b, and c, if R(a,b) and R(b,c) are true, then R(a,c) is true.
      Meaning: This defines the property of transitivity for any relation R.

3. Key Points:
   - Equation (a) seems to contradict (b). This likely represents different states of the world (initial vs. possible future state).
   - Equation (b) implies that the vacuum can coexist with dirt in the same location, possibly representing a state before cleaning.
   - Equation (c) is a general logical statement about transitive relations, not specific to the vacuum world but useful in logical reasoning.

4. Implications for AI Planning:
   - These statements provide both constraints and possibilities for the AI system.
   - The planner must consider how to move from the state in (a) to achieve states like (b), and then to a clean state.
   - Understanding transitive relations (c) could be crucial for planning efficient cleaning routes.

5. FOL Advantages:
   - Allows expression of complex relationships and rules.
   - Can represent both specific facts (like the vacuum's location) and general rules (like the definition of transitivity).
   - Provides a foundation for logical inference in AI systems.

These equations demonstrate how First Order Logic can be used to represent and reason about complex scenarios in AI planning 
and problem-solving.


Question 1:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? ∃x: y: x = y

Correct Answer: Satisfiable
Explanation: This sentence states that there exists an x such that for all y, x equals y. This is satisfiable in a domain 
with only one element, where every x and y would be equal. However, it's not valid because it's not true in all possible 
domains (e.g., a domain with multiple distinct elements).

Question 2:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? (∃x: x = x) ∨ (∀y ∃z: y = z)

Correct Answer: Valid
Explanation: This sentence is always true, making it valid. The left part (∃x: x = x) is always true because for any domain, 
there exists an x that equals itself. Even if the right part were false, the sentence would still be true due to the OR (∨) 
operator.

Question 3:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? ∀x: P(x) ∨ ¬ P(x)

Correct Answer: Valid
Explanation: This sentence is a tautology in first-order logic. For any predicate P and any object x, either P(x) is true 
or its negation ¬P(x) is true. This holds for all possible interpretations of P and all possible domains, making it valid.

Question 4:
Is the following sentence valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable? ∃x: P(x)

Correct Answer: Satisfiable
Explanation: This sentence states that there exists an x for which the predicate P is true. It's satisfiable because we 
can construct a model where P is true for at least one object. However, it's not valid because we can also construct 
models where P is false for all objects. It's also not unsatisfiable because it can be true in some models.


List of logical statements under the heading "VSU", which stands for Valid, Satisfiable, and Unsatisfiable. 

1. ∃x,y x=y
   - This statement is Satisfiable.
   - It means "There exist x and y such that x equals y."
   - This is true in any non-empty domain, as any object can be equal to itself.

2. (∃x x=x) ⇒ (∀y ∃z y=z)
   - This statement is Valid.
   - The left side (∃x x=x) is always true in any non-empty domain.
   - The right side (∀y ∃z y=z) is also always true, as for any y, we can choose z to be y itself.
   - Since the implication is from a true statement to another true statement, it's always valid.

3. ∀x P(x) ∨ ¬P(x)
   - This statement is Valid.
   - For any x, either P(x) is true or its negation ¬P(x) is true.
   - This is a tautology in first-order logic, true for any predicate P and any domain.

4. ∃x P(x)
   - This statement is Satisfiable.
   - It means "There exists an x for which P(x) is true."
   - This can be true or false depending on the interpretation of P and the domain.
   - It's not valid (as it's not necessarily true for all interpretations) and not unsatisfiable (as we can construct models where it's true).

The VSU classification helps in understanding the nature of these logical statements:
- Valid statements are true in all possible interpretations.
- Satisfiable statements are true in at least one interpretation.
- Unsatisfiable statements are false in all possible interpretations.

This classification is crucial in logic and reasoning systems, helping to determine which statements are always true, which 
can be true under certain conditions, and which are never true.

1. ∃x,y Job(Sam,x) ∧ Job(Sam,y) ∧ ¬(x=y)
   Answer: Y (Yes)
   Explanation: This statement is true (Yes) because it asserts that Sam has at least two different jobs. The existential 
   quantifier (∃) allows for the possibility of Sam having multiple jobs, and the inequality (¬(x=y)) ensures they are distinct.

2. ∀x,s Member(x, Add(x,s))
   Answer: Y (Yes)
   Explanation: This is likely true (Yes) as it states that for all x and s, x is a member of the set resulting from adding 
   x to s. This is a fundamental property of set addition.

3. ∀x,s Member(x,s) ⇒ (∀y Member(x, Add(y,s)))
   Answer: Y (Yes)
   Explanation: This is true (Yes) because it states that if x is a member of s, then x remains a member of s after adding 
   any y to s. This is a logical property of set operations.

4. ∀x,y Adj(Sq(x,y), Sq(+(x,1),y)) ∧ Adj(Sq(x,y), Sq(x,+(y,1)))
   Answer: Y (Yes)
   Explanation: This statement is true (Yes) as it defines adjacent squares on a grid. It states that for all x and y, the 
   square at (x,y) is adjacent to the square at (x+1,y) and the square at (x,y+1). This correctly defines horizontal and 
   vertical adjacency in a grid.

The "Y N | Adjacent squares" header suggests that these statements are all true (Y) and relate to the concept of adjacent squares, 
which is consistent with the explanations provided.



Question 1:
Is the following first-order logic sentence a good representation of the English language sentence, "Sam has two jobs"?
∃x, y: Job(Sam, x) ∧ Job(Sam, y) ∧ ¬(x = y)

Correct Answer: Yes

Explanation: This first-order logic sentence accurately represents "Sam has two jobs." It states that there exist two 
things (x and y) such that both are jobs of Sam (Job(Sam, x) and Job(Sam, y)), and these two things are not the same (¬(x = y)). 
This captures the essence of having two distinct jobs.

Question 2:
Are the following first-order logic sentences a good representation of the concept of set membership?
∀x, s: Member(x, Add(x, s)) ∀x, s: Member(x, s) ⇒ (∀y: Member(x, Add(y, s)))

Correct Answer: Yes

Explanation: These sentences accurately represent key properties of set membership:

   1. The first sentence states that for any x and set s, x is a member of the set resulting from adding x to s.

   2. The second sentence states that if x is a member of s, then x remains a member of s after adding any y to s.
   These properties correctly describe how set membership behaves under addition operations.

Question 3:
Is the following first-order logic sentence a good representation of the concept of adjacent squares on a chessboard?
∀x, y: Adj(sq(x, y), sq(+(x, 1), y)) ∧ Adj(sq(x, y), sq(x, +(y, 1)))

Correct Answer: Yes

Explanation: This sentence accurately represents adjacent squares on a chessboard:

   1. It states that for all x and y coordinates, the square at (x, y) is adjacent to the square at (x+1, y) (horizontally 
   adjacent).

   2. It also states that the square at (x, y) is adjacent to the square at (x, y+1) (vertically adjacent).

This captures both horizontal and vertical adjacency, which are the two types of adjacency on a chessboard (excluding diagonal 
adjacency, which isn't typically considered in chess movements except for specific pieces).


Planning VS Execution
<br>
––––––––––––––––––


Planning vs. Execution Challenges in Real-World Scenarios:

1. Uncertain Environments:
   a) Stochastic:
      - Outcomes of actions are not deterministic
      - Results can't be predicted with certainty
      - Example: Weather affecting outdoor plans

   b) Multiagent:
      - Multiple actors in the environment
      - Actions of one agent affect others
      - Example: Traffic flow affected by multiple drivers

   c) Partial Observability:
      - Agent can't fully observe the environment
      - Relies on belief state rather than actual state
      - Example: Robot navigation with limited sensor range

2. Agent's Internal Knowledge:
   a) Unknown:
      - Agent lacks prior knowledge about certain states
      - Must learn or discover information during execution
      - Example: Exploring an unmapped area

   b) Hierarchical:
      - Actions and outcomes aren't linear
      - Involves nested or layered decision-making
      - Example: Project management with multiple subprojects

3. Key Terminology:
   - Non-deterministic vs. Stochastic:
     * Both describe uncertainty
     * Stochastic: Quantifiable randomness (probabilities)
     * Non-deterministic: Different outcomes possible, not quantified

4. Implications for Planning:
   - Plans must be flexible and adaptable
   - Need for contingency planning
   - Importance of real-time decision making
   - Continuous monitoring and re-planning may be necessary

5. Strategies to Address Challenges:
   - Probabilistic planning methods
   - Multi-agent coordination algorithms
   - Belief state updating techniques
   - Learning and adaptation mechanisms
   - Hierarchical planning approaches

6. [A,S,F,B] Notation:
   - Likely represents different aspects or approaches to planning
   - Could stand for: Action, State, Function, Belief (but context is needed for confirmation)


These challenges highlight the complexity of real-world planning and the need for sophisticated AI planning systems that 
can handle uncertainty, partial information, and dynamic environments.


Lecture Notes: Vacuum Cleaner Planning Problem

1. Fully Observable, Deterministic Environment:
   - 2 locations: A (left) and B (right)
   - Vacuum cleaner can be in either location
   - Dirt can be present or absent in each location
   - Total states: 2 (vacuum position) x 2 (A dirt) x 2 (B dirt) = 8 states
   - Actions: Move Left, Move Right, Suck
   - Planning is straightforward: search through state space for goal state

2. Unobservable (Sensorless) Environment:
   - Vacuum cleaner's sensors break down
   - Cannot determine location or presence of dirt
   - Introduces concept of "belief state"

3. Belief States:
   - Represent all possible states the agent could be in
   - Initial belief state: all 8 possible states
   - Actions change belief states, not just individual states

4. Planning with Belief States:
   - Search occurs in the space of belief states
   - Each action transforms one belief state into another
   - Goal is to reach a belief state where all possible states are goal states

5. Implications:
   - Increases complexity of planning
   - Requires considering all possible outcomes of actions
   - Introduces uncertainty into the planning process

6. Advantages of Belief State Planning:
   - Can handle partial observability
   - More robust in real-world scenarios
   - Allows for contingency planning

Explanation:
This example illustrates the transition from simple, fully observable environments to more complex, partially observable 
ones. In the real world, agents (like robots or AI systems) often have to deal with uncertainty and incomplete information. 
The concept of belief states allows us to model this uncertainty explicitly.

Instead of knowing exactly which state the system is in, we maintain a set of possible states (the belief state). Actions 
then transform these belief states. The challenge becomes finding a sequence of actions that, regardless of the actual 
initial state, will lead to a desirable outcome.

This approach is more powerful and flexible than traditional state-space search, as it can handle a wider range of real-world 
scenarios where perfect information is not available. It's a crucial concept in AI planning, robotics, and decision-making under 
uncertainty.


Agent's belief state includes all 8 possible states (2 locations x 2 dirt conditions for each location). Let's explain this:

1. There are 2 locations: A (left) and B (right)

2. For each location, there are 2 possible dirt conditions:
   - Clean (no dirt)
   - Dirty (has dirt)

3. The vacuum cleaner can be in either location A or B

So, we calculate the total number of possible states:

* Vacuum location options: 2 (A or B)
* Dirt condition for location A: 2 (Clean or Dirty)
* Dirt condition for location B: 2 (Clean or Dirty)

Total combinations: 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 possible states

These 8 states are:
1. (Vacuum in A, A clean, B clean)
2. (Vacuum in A, A clean, B dirty)
3. (Vacuum in A, A dirty, B clean)
4. (Vacuum in A, A dirty, B dirty)
5. (Vacuum in B, A clean, B clean)
6. (Vacuum in B, A clean, B dirty)
7. (Vacuum in B, A dirty, B clean)
8. (Vacuum in B, A dirty, B dirty)


In the sensorless scenario, because the vacuum cleaner can't determine its location or sense dirt, all of these 8 states 
are possible in its initial belief state. The agent must consider all these possibilities when planning its actions.


1. Belief State:
   - A belief state is a set of all possible actual states the agent might be in, given its lack of sensory information.
   - In the sensorless vacuum cleaner problem, because the agent can't sense its location or the presence of dirt, it must consider all possibilities.

2. Initial Belief State:
   - At the start, the agent's belief state includes all 8 possible states (2 locations x 2 dirt conditions for each location).
   - This is represented by the box encompassing all states in the diagram.

3. Actions and Belief State Transitions:
   - Move Left (L), Move Right (R), Suck (S)
   - When the agent takes an action, it transitions to a new belief state.
   - The new belief state represents all possible states the agent could be in after taking that action.

4. Example Transitions:
   - If the agent moves right (R) from the initial belief state, its new belief state would exclude all left-side states.
   - If the agent sucks (S), its new belief state would include states where the current location (whichever it might be) is clean.

5. Goal in Belief Space:
   - The goal is to reach a belief state where all possible states within it are goal states (i.e., both locations are clean).

6. Planning in Belief Space:
   - The agent plans a sequence of actions that will lead from the initial belief state to a goal belief state.
   - This sequence must work regardless of which actual state the agent started in.


The key idea is that instead of planning in the space of actual states (which the agent can't observe), it plans in the 
space of belief states, which represent its knowledge and uncertainty about the world. Each action updates this knowledge, 
narrowing down the possibilities until the agent can be certain it has achieved its goal.


Question:
Which of the following plans will lead to a state where we know all squares are clean?
Use 'L' for left, 'R' for right, and 'S' for suck.

Correct Answer:
None of these, and there does not exist a plan that will guarantee achieving the goal.

Explanation:
1. Sensorless Environment: The vacuum cleaner cannot determine its location or detect dirt.
2. Slippery Floor (Stochastic Environment): Movement actions (L or R) may fail, leaving the vacuum in its current location.

Given these conditions:
- No finite sequence of actions can guarantee with 100% certainty that both squares are clean.
- Even if a sequence like SRSRS is executed, there's no guarantee that the 'R' (Right) movements will succeed due to the slippery floor.
- The vacuum has no way to confirm its location or the cleanliness of the squares due to lack of sensors.

This scenario demonstrates the challenges of planning in stochastic, partially observable environments:
- Actions may not have deterministic outcomes.
- The agent cannot rely on sensory feedback to confirm the results of its actions.
- It's impossible to guarantee a specific outcome with a fixed, finite plan.

In such environments, instead of a guaranteed plan, we would typically use probabilistic approaches or policies that adapt over 
time, aiming to increase the likelihood of achieving the goal state without being able to guarantee it absolutely.


Planning in Deterministic vs. Stochastic Environments

1. Problem Representation:
   [A,S,F] - Likely represents Actions, States, and Functions/Goals

2. Goal Representation:
   Result(Result(A,A → S), S → F) ← Goals
   This indicates a sequence of actions and their results leading to the goal state.

3. Deterministic Environments:
   - State transitions are predictable
   - Represented as: s1 = Result(s,a)
     Where:
     s1 is the new state
     s is the current state
     a is the action taken

4. Stochastic and Partially-Observable Environments:
   - State transitions are uncertain
   - Agent works with belief states rather than exact states
   - Two-step iterative process:
     a) Prediction: b' = Predict(b,a)
        Where:
        b' is the predicted belief state
        b is the current belief state
        a is the action taken

     b) Update: b1 = Update(Predict(b,a), o)
        Where:
        b1 is the updated belief state
        o is the observation after taking action a

5. Key Differences:
   - Deterministic: Direct state observation
   - Stochastic: Belief state updates based on predictions and observations

6. Implications for Planning:
   - Deterministic: Can plan a fixed sequence of actions
   - Stochastic: Requires adaptive planning, considering uncertainties

7. Belief State Concept:
   - Represents a distribution over possible states
   - Updated based on actions and observations
   - Crucial for decision-making in uncertain environments

8. Predict-Update Cycle:
   - Predict: Estimates possible outcomes of an action
   - Update: Incorporates new observations to refine the belief state

This approach allows for planning in environments where the outcomes of actions are not certain and the agent's knowledge 
of the world state is incomplete. It's a fundamental concept in AI planning for real-world scenarios where uncertainty and 
partial observability are common.


Predict-Update Cycle and Planning Graphs in AI Planning

1. Predict-Update Cycle in Stochastic Environments:

   a) Belief States (b1, b2, b3, b4, b5):
      - Represent possible world states due to uncertainty
      - Updated through actions and observations

   b) PREDICT function:
      - Estimates new belief state after an action
      - Example: b2 = PREDICT(b1, Suck)

   c) UPDATE function:
      - Refines belief state based on observations
      - Example: b3 = UPDATE(b1, [A, Clean])

   d) Action Sequence:
      - Suck → [A, Clean] observation → Right → [B, Dirty] observation

   e) Belief State Transitions:
      b1 → b2 (after Suck) → b3 (after [A, Clean] update) → b4 (after Right) → b5 (after [B, Dirty] update)


2. Planning Graphs:

   a) Definition:
      - Special data structure for heuristic estimates
      - Directed graph with alternating layers

   b) Structure:
      - Alternates between state and action layers
      - Includes preconditions and effects of actions

   c) Purpose:
      - Provides better heuristic estimates
      - Maps initial state to goal states more effectively

   d) Components:
      - State layers: Represent possible world states
      - Action layers: Represent possible actions
      - Precondition links: Connect states to actions
      - Effect links: Connect actions to resulting states

   e) Advantages:
      - Improves planning efficiency
      - Handles uncertainty and partial observability

3. Application in Vacuum Cleaner Scenario:

   - Initial belief state (b1): Uncertainty about cleaner location and dirt
   - Actions: Suck, Right
   - Observations: [A, Clean], [B, Dirty]
   - Final belief state (b5): Updated knowledge after actions and observations

4. Key Concepts:

   - Stochastic environment: Outcomes of actions are uncertain
   - Partial observability: Agent doesn't have full information about the world state
   - Belief state: Probability distribution over possible world states
   - Planning under uncertainty: Requires adaptive strategies

5. Next Steps:

   - Detailed exploration of planning graph structure
   - Understanding heuristic generation from planning graphs
   - Applying planning graphs to more complex scenarios


This approach allows AI systems to plan effectively in real-world scenarios where perfect information is not available, 
and actions may have unpredictable outcomes.

1. State Space Representation:
   a) Complete Assignment:
      - Every variable is assigned a value
      - Represents a fully defined state
      - Suitable for deterministic and fully observable environments

   b) Partial Assignment:
      - Only some variables are assigned values
      - Represents incomplete knowledge of the state
      - Useful in stochastic and partially observable environments

   c) Belief State Space:

      - Essential for planning in uncertain environments

   2. State Space Characteristics:
      - k-Boolean (2^k): Represents the total number of possible states
      - For the vacuum cleaner example: 3 Boolean variables (Dirt A, Dirt B, Vac A)
        Total possible states: 2^3 = 8 states

      3. Action Representation:
         a) Action Schema:
            - Defines possible actions in a given state
            - Components:
              * Action name

         b) Example: Fly Action Schema
   
      ```textmate
         Action(Fly(p, from, to),
                    PRECOND: At(p, from) ∧ Plane(p) ∧ Airport(from) ∧ Airport(to)
                    EFFECT: ¬At(p, from) ∧ At(p, to))
      ```
      
      - Name: Fly
      - Variables: p (plane), from (departure airport), to (arrival airport)
      - Preconditions: Plane is at departure airport, both locations are airports
      - Effects: Plane is no longer at departure, now at arrival airport

4. Planning Process:
   - Agent uses action schemas to determine possible actions
   - Evaluates preconditions against current state
   - Applies effects to predict new states
   - Builds a plan by chaining actions to reach goal state

5. Advantages of Classical Planning:
   - Provides a structured approach to problem-solving

   - May struggle with highly complex or uncertain environments
   - Assumes perfect knowledge in complete assignments

7. Applications:
   - Robotics navigation
   - Logistics and supply chain optimization
   - Game AI for strategy games


This framework of Classical Planning provides a foundation for more advanced planning techniques, especially when dealing 
with real-world complexities and uncertainties.


Classical Planning Actions Representation

A planning agent relies on the action schemas to know what actions are possible in the current state. An action schema consists of
the action name,  a list of state variables in current space, the preconditions to create this action schema possible, and the effects 
after this action is completed. An example of an action schema is as follows:


```textmate
Action (Fly (p, from , to ),  
	PRECOND:At(p, from) ∧ Plane(p) ∧ Airport(from) ∧ Airport(to) 
	EFFECT:¬At(p, from) ∧ At(p, to))
```

Schema: Action()
Action name: Fly
A list of state variables: plane (p), the airport it flies from (from), and the airport it's flying to (to)
Preconditions: there is a plane ("Plane(p )") and two airports ("Airport(from)") and "Airport(to)"), the current location of the plane("At(p, from)")
Effects: the plane is no longer at previous location ("¬At(p, from)") and plane's new location("At(p, to)")



This is an action schema in classical planning, specifically for a "Fly" action. Let's break it down in detail:

```textmate
Action(Fly(p, from, to),
  PRECOND: At(p, from) ∧ Plane(p) ∧ Airport(from) ∧ Airport(to)
  EFFECT: ¬At(p, from) ∧ At(p, to))
```


1. Action Name: Fly
   - This defines the action being described.

2. Parameters: (p, from, to)
   - p: represents the plane
   - from: represents the departure airport
   - to: represents the destination airport

3. PRECOND (Preconditions):
   - At(p, from): The plane p is currently at the departure airport 'from'
   - Plane(p): p is indeed a plane
   - Airport(from): 'from' is an airport
   - Airport(to): 'to' is an airport
   - The ∧ symbol represents logical AND, meaning all these conditions must be true for the action to be possible

4. EFFECT (Effects):
   - ¬At(p, from): The plane p is no longer at the departure airport 'from'
     (¬ represents logical NOT)
   - At(p, to): The plane p is now at the destination airport 'to'
   - The ∧ symbol here means both these effects occur simultaneously

Explanation of how this works in planning:

1. Before the action can be executed, the planner checks if all preconditions are met in the current state.

2. If the preconditions are satisfied, the action can be applied.

3. When applied, the effects modify the current state:
   - It removes the fact that the plane is at the departure airport
   - It adds the fact that the plane is at the destination airport

4. This new state then becomes the basis for the next action in the plan.



This action schema allows the planner to reason about moving planes between airports. It ensures that planes only fly between 
actual airports and that a plane must be at the departure airport before it can fly to the destination. The effects accurately 
represent the change in the plane's location after the flight.


Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)

The writings of planning domains and problems are commonly standardized in a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). 
A complete PDDL consists of an initialization of the planning domains, the goal of the planning problem, and a set of 
action schemas.

An example of a PDDL is as follows:

```textmate
Init(At(C1, SFO) ∧ At(C2, JFK) ∧ At(P1, SFO) ∧ At(P2, JFK) 
∧ Cargo(C1) ∧ Cargo(C2) ∧ Plane(P1) ∧ Plane(P2)  
∧ Airport(JFK) ∧ Airport(SFO))

Goal(At(C1, JFK) ∧ At(C2, SFO)) 

Action(Load(c, p, a),
	PRECOND: At(c, a) ∧ At(p, a) ∧ Cargo(c) ∧ Plane(p) ∧ Airport(a)
	EFFECT: ¬ At(c, a) ∧ In(c, p)) 

Action(Unload(c, p, a),
	PRECOND: In(c, p) ∧ At(p, a) ∧ Cargo(c) ∧ Plane(p) ∧ Airport(a)
	EFFECT: At(c, a) ∧ ¬ In(c, p)) 

Action(Fly(p, from, to),
	PRECOND: At(p, from) ∧ Plane(p) ∧ Airport(from) ∧ Airport(to) 	
	EFFECT: ¬ At(p, from) ∧ At(p, to))
```


Classical planning problem for cargo transportation:

1. Initial State (Init):
   - C1 (Cargo 1) is at SFO (San Francisco Airport)
   - C2 (Cargo 2) is at JFK (John F. Kennedy Airport)
   - P1 (Plane 1) is at SFO
   - P2 (Plane 2) is at JFK
   - C1 and C2 are defined as Cargo
   - P1 and P2 are defined as Planes
   - JFK and SFO are defined as Airports

2. Goal State:
   - C1 should be at JFK
   - C2 should be at SFO
   (Essentially, the cargos need to swap locations)

3. Actions:
   a) Load(c, p, a):
      - Loads cargo c into plane p at airport a
      - Preconditions:
        * Cargo c is at airport a
        * Plane p is at airport a
        * c is Cargo, p is a Plane, a is an Airport
      - Effects:
        * Cargo c is no longer at airport a
        * Cargo c is now in plane p

   b) Unload(c, p, a):
      - Unloads cargo c from plane p at airport a
      - Preconditions:
        * Cargo c is in plane p
        * Plane p is at airport a
        * c is Cargo, p is a Plane, a is an Airport
      - Effects:
        * Cargo c is now at airport a
        * Cargo c is no longer in plane p

   c) Fly(p, from, to):
      - Flies plane p from airport 'from' to airport 'to'
      - Preconditions:
        * Plane p is at airport 'from'
        * p is a Plane, 'from' and 'to' are Airports
      - Effects:
        * Plane p is no longer at airport 'from'
        * Plane p is now at airport 'to'

To solve this problem, a planner would need to:
1. Load C1 into P1 at SFO
2. Fly P1 from SFO to JFK
3. Unload C1 from P1 at JFK
4. Load C2 into P1 at JFK
5. Fly P1 from JFK to SFO
6. Unload C2 from P1 at SFO


This sequence of actions would achieve the goal state. The planner would use the action schemas to determine which actions 
are possible at each step and how they change the world state, gradually working towards the goal state.


Progression Search in Planning Problems


There are two approaches to find possible solutions in the planning problem state space. They are

   1. Progression Search: a forward search from the initial state to the goal state.
   2. Regression Search: a reverse search from the goal state back to the initial state.

In a tree search, we stack the nodes from top to bottom (the initial state is set as the root node). In the planning graph, 
it is common to line up the initial state to the goal state from left to right. In the progression search, we start from the 
initial node on the left and expand the nodes to the right until we find the possible solutions by reaching the goal states.

While the progression search is commonly used, there are two limitations with this approach:

The graph may explore unnecessary actions. For example, the graph may explore a state where a plane with an empty cargo flies 
from one airport to another. The graph may require large storage as the number of nodes expands exponentially with the number 
of variables. 



1. Definition:
   Progression Search is a forward search strategy that starts from the initial state and moves towards the goal state in planning problems.

2. Process:
   a) Start with the initial state (e.g., At(P1, SFO), At(C1, SFO))
   b) Apply possible actions (e.g., Load(C1, P1, SFO))
   c) Generate new states
   d) Continue until a goal state is reached

3. Visual Representation:
   - Initial state on the left
   - Goal state on the right
   - States and actions represented as nodes and edges in between

4. Example (from image):
   Initial State: At(P1, SFO), At(C1, SFO)
   Action: Load(C1, P1, SFO)
   New State: In(C1, P1), At(P1, SFO)

5. Advantages:
   - Intuitive approach
   - Can find solutions by systematically exploring the state space

6. Limitations:
   a) May explore unnecessary actions:
      - E.g., flying an empty plane between airports
   b) State space explosion:
      - Number of nodes grows exponentially with the number of variables
      - Can require large storage and computational resources

7. Comparison:
   - Contrasted with Regression Search, which works backwards from the goal state

8. Applications:
   - Used in various planning scenarios, including logistics, robotics, and scheduling

9. Considerations:
   - Efficiency can be improved with heuristics and pruning techniques
   - May be combined with other search strategies for better performance

10. Next Steps:
    - Exploration of Regression Search as an alternative approach
    - Focus on relevant action schemas from the goal state


This approach provides a systematic way to explore the planning problem space, but it's important to be aware of its limitations 
and consider alternative or complementary strategies for complex problems.


Regression Search in Planning Problems

1. Definition:
   Regression Search, also known as relevant-state search, is a backward search strategy that starts from the goal state and 
   works towards the initial state in planning problems.

2. Process:
   a) Start with the goal state (e.g., At(C1, JFK), At(C2, SFO))
   b) Identify relevant actions that could lead to the goal state
   c) Work backward, applying inverse actions
   d) Continue until the initial state is reached

3. Key Characteristics:
   - Uses action schemas, preconditions, and effects to guide the search
   - Expands only relevant nodes based on action schemas
   - Typically has a smaller branching factor compared to progression search

4. Example (from image):
   Goal State: At(C1, JFK), At(C2, SFO)
   Relevant Action: Unload(C1, P, JFK)
   Preconditions added: In(C1, P), At(P, JFK)

5. Action Schema (Unload):
   PRECOND: In(c,p) ∧ At(p, a) ∧ Cargo(c) ∧ Plane(p) ∧ Airport(a)
   EFFECT: At(c, a) ∧ ¬In(c,p)

6. Advantages:
   - Focuses on relevant actions and states
   - Reduces the search space compared to progression search
   - Can be more efficient in certain types of problems

7. Limitations:
   - Difficulty in applying heuristics to speed up the search
   - May struggle with problems where the goal state is less well-defined

8. Comparison to Progression Search:
   - Regression: works backward from goal to initial state
   - Progression: works forward from initial state to goal

9. Applications:
   - Effective in domains where the goal state is well-defined
   - Useful in planning problems with many irrelevant actions

10. Considerations:
    - Choice between regression and progression search depends on the specific problem characteristics
    - May be combined with other techniques for improved performance

11. Key Takeaway:
    Regression search can be more efficient by focusing on relevant states and actions, but it has limitations in applying 
    heuristics for search optimization.


This approach provides an alternative strategy for exploring the planning problem space, particularly useful when the goal 
state is well-defined and there are many potentially irrelevant actions in the problem domain.




Classical Planning - Summary
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––


In the following project, you will implement a planning graph, which is a special data structure that is optimized to search 
for the solutions for a PDDL.

A planning graph is a directed graph organized into levels: the first level S0 is the initial state, consisting of nodes 
representing each fluent; then the first level A0 consisting of nodes for each possible action from the states in S0; followed 
by the alternating levels of Si and Ai until we reach a termination condition. A planning graph terminates when two consecutive 
levels are identical. At this point, we say that the graph has leveled off.

A planning graph is more efficient than progression and regression searches because the graphplan algorithm can eliminate 
conflicting actions within an action layer. The conflicting actions can be prevented by the mutual exclusion (mutex) relationships. 
When the algorithm decides to not taking any action, it is called taking a persistence action, also known as no-op.

There are three possible mutex conditions holds between two actions:

Inconsistent effects: one action negates an effect of the other. For example, Load(Cargo) and the persistence of Unload(Cargo) 
have inconsistent effects because they disagree on the effect Unload(Cargo). Interference: one of the effects of one action 
is the negation of a precondition of the other. For example Fly(p, a, b) interferes with the persistence of At(p, a) by negating 
its precondition. Competing needs: one of the preconditions of one action is mutually exclusive with a precondition of the other. 
For example, Fly(p, a, b) and Fly(p, a, c) are mutex because they compete on the value of the At(p, a) precondition. The planning 
graph is a robust data structure to solve a planning problem. If a solution is not found by the end of the planning graph layer, 
the problem is considered unsolvable.

The planning graph can also provide a heuristic estimation, which calculates the cost to reach the goal states. The cost is known 
as the level cost based on the number of layers that the algorithm needs to go through to find the solutions. For example, let’s 
say we have a planning graph with the following alternating layers: S0, A0, S1, A1, S2, A2, S3, A3. If the algorithm finds the 
conjunction goals at S2 and S3, we can say the cost or level-sum heuristic estimation is 5 (=2 + 3).

Sliding Puzzle Action Schema:

1. Action: Slide(t,a,b)
   - t: tile being moved
   - a: starting position
   - b: destination position

2. Preconditions (Pre):
   - On(t,a): Tile t is on position a
   - Tile(t): t is a tile
   - Blank(b): Position b is blank (empty)
   - Adj(a,b): Positions a and b are adjacent

3. Effects (EFF):
   - On(t,b): Tile t is now on position b
   - Blank(a): Position a is now blank
   - ¬On(t,a): Tile t is no longer on position a
   - ¬Blank(b): Position b is no longer blank

Key Points:
1. This action represents sliding a tile from one position to an adjacent empty position.
2. The puzzle consists of tiles and blank spaces on a grid.
3. Moves are only possible to adjacent blank spaces.
4. Each move changes the state of two positions: the start and destination.
5. The action preserves the overall structure of the puzzle (number of tiles and blank spaces).

Implications for Planning:
- The planner must consider the arrangement of tiles and blank spaces.
- Only one tile can be moved at a time.
- The sequence of moves is important to reach the goal state.
- The branching factor at each state depends on the number of tiles adjacent to the blank space.


This action schema forms the basis for solving sliding puzzle problems in automated planning systems. It defines the rules 
and constraints of the puzzle, allowing a planner to generate valid sequences of moves to reach a goal configuration.




Situation Calculus in AI Planning


Situation Calculus
Successor - State Axioms

Once we've described this in the ordinary language
of first order logic

We don't need any special programs to manipulate
it and come up with the solution

Because we already have
theorem provers for first order logic

```textmate
Situation Calculus
First order logic (FOL)

Actions: objects    Fly(p,x,y)

Situations: objects    S0   S'=Result(s,a)
Poss(a,s)             --Actions(s)--
SomePrecond(s) ⇒ Poss(a,s)

Plane(p,s) ∧ Airport(x,s) ∧ Airport(y,s) ∧ At(p,x,s) ⇒
                    Poss(Fly(p,x,y)

1. Introduction to Situation Calculus:
Situation Calculus is a logical formalism used in artificial intelligence for representing and reasoning about dynamic worlds. 
It's particularly useful in AI planning, where we need to model how actions change the state of the world.

2. Key Components:

a) Actions: Objects that represent things that can be done. 
   Example: Fly(p,x,y) - representing a plane p flying from x to y

b) Situations: Objects that represent the state of the world.
   - S0: Initial state
   - S' = Result(s,a): The situation that results from performing action a in situation s

c) Fluents: Properties that can change over time.
   Example: At(p,x,s) - true if plane p is at location x in situation s

3. First-Order Logic (FOL) Representation:
Situation Calculus uses first-order logic to describe the world and its changes. This allows us to use existing theorem 
provers for first-order logic to reason about dynamic situations.

4. Key Predicates:

a) Poss(a,s): Action a is possible in situation s
b) SomePreCond(s) ⇒ Poss(a,s): Some precondition must be true for an action to be possible

5. Axioms:

a) Successor-State Axioms:
   These describe how fluents change with actions. For example:
   At(p,x,s) ∧ ∀a, s Poss(a,s) ⇒ (fluent true ⇔ a made it true ∨ a didn't undo)

b) Action Precondition Axioms:
   Example for the Fly action:
   Plane(p,s) ∧ Airport(x,s) ∧ Airport(y,s) ∧ At(p,x,s) ⇒ Poss(Fly(p,x,y),s)

6. Example Scenario - Cargo Transport:

Initial state: At(P1,JFK,S0)  ∀c Cargo(c) ⇒ At(c,JFK,S0)
Goal: ∃s ∀c Cargo(c) ⇒ At(c,SFO,s)

This represents a scenario where a plane P1 and all cargo start at JFK airport, and the goal is to have all cargo at SFO 
airport in some future situation.

7. Planning Process:
To solve this problem, an AI planner would:
1. Start from the initial state S0
2. Use the axioms to determine possible actions
3. Apply actions to generate new situations
4. Continue until it reaches a situation that satisfies the goal condition

8. Advantages of Situation Calculus:
- Provides a formal, logical framework for reasoning about actions and change
- Can handle complex scenarios with multiple objects and actions
- Allows for the use of existing theorem provers for first-order logic

9. Challenges:
- Can be computationally expensive for complex scenarios
- Requires careful formulation of axioms to avoid inconsistencies


By using Situation Calculus, AI planners can formally represent and reason about complex, dynamic worlds, enabling them to 
solve sophisticated planning problems.
